<p>
Student, musical theater geek, food aficionado, and surfer from San Diego, CA who somehow made 
it to Tufts University in Boston, Massachussets for college. In the summers, he is a camp counselor 
for an academic and life skills camp for middle school to college-aged students. After starting
this year at Tufts as a Global Orientation Host Advisor, he is currently a member of 180 Degrees
Consulting, TEDxTufts, and the Intro to Compter Science Teaching team. When he's not listening
to Lin Manuel Miranda, you may find him at CorePower Yoga or finding the closest acai bowl or avocado toast in his vicinity.
